# Balance
Balance is an app that allows you to track your thoughts, helping you to manage your mental health. You can create notes to record your thoughts and a stats section to analize them.

## Description

It was made using TypeScript and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) was used to work with global states. The syles were made using pure CSS.
